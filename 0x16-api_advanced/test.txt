The project aims to address several challenges and problems related to music organization and personalization:

Disorganized Music Collections: Many individuals have large and disorganized music collections without accurate artist names, album titles, or other metadata, making it difficult to find and enjoy specific tracks.

Missing Album Artwork: Music tracks often lack album artwork, leading to a less visually appealing and engaging music library.

Inaccurate Information: Incorrect or incomplete metadata can lead to confusion about artists, song titles, and release years.

Limited Personalization: Without proper metadata, users miss out on the opportunity to personalize their music collection with relevant information and preferences.

Historical Context: Lack of metadata can result in the loss of historical context, making it hard to understand the significance of certain tracks within specific periods or genres.

Playlist Creation: Inaccurate or missing metadata can hinder the creation of well-organized playlists, compilations, or themed collections.

Professional Use: DJs, event organizers, and content creators require accurate metadata for their work, and the absence of such information can affect the quality and relevance of their output.

Educational Value: Educators and students studying music can face challenges if tracks lack accurate information about artists, genres, and historical significance.

Cultural Preservation: Inaccurate metadata can lead to the misidentification or misrepresentation of music from different cultures, impacting cultural preservation efforts.

Aesthetic Appeal: A lack of album artwork and consistent metadata can diminish the aesthetic appeal of music players and libraries.

User Experience: Without metadata, users might struggle to navigate and enjoy their music library, leading to a less satisfying user experience.
